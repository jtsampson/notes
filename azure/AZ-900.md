# Introduction Azure Fundamentals
## Core Concepts
### Cloud Computing
>The delivery of computer services over the internet (the cloud).
 - **Services** include
    - Servers
    - Storage
    - Databases
    - Networking
    - Software
    - Analytics
    - Intelligence
 - **Service Cost** less on average as you pay as you go for what you use.
 - **Advantages**
    - **Reliability:** Depending on chosen service level a company can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime
    - **Scalability:** Services can be scaled _horizintally_ and/or _vertically_
      - Vertically: Add more RAM or CPU
      - Horizontally: Add more instances of resources
    - **Elasticity:** Services can be configured to always have the resources they need
    - **Geo-distribution:** Applications and Data can be deployed closer to your users
    - **Disaster Recovery:** Various back up services and data replication strategies exist such that data can be recovered in case of disaster.

### Cloud Service Models

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
> A physical server level management model. The Cloud provider manages computing resources, network and storage.
> The tenant manages the VMs, OS, Runtimes, Applications, Data and Access. Supports rapid deployment of new compute 
> devices. 

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
> A hosting environment level management model. The cloud provider manages the IaaS aspects, plus VMs, OS and runtimes. 
> The tenant manages the Applications, Data and Access.  Supports rapid deployment of application w/o having 
> to deal with HW and SW requirements.

**Software as a Service (SaaS):**
> An application level management model. The could provided manages Paas aspects, plus the Application. 
> The tenant only needs to bring their Data and Access. Ex. Microsoft Office 365.

In the table below, the cloud provider manages *these*, the tenant`these`.

| On Prem Private Cloud  |  Iaas           | Paas            | Saas 
|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------|:---------------:
| `Data & Access`        | `Data & Access` | `Data & Access` | `Data & Access` 
| `Applications`         | `Applications`  | `Applications`  | *Applications*
| `Runtime`              | `Runtime`       | *Runtime*       | *Runtime*       
| `OS`                   | `OS`            | *OS*            | *OS*            
| `VM`                   | `VM`            | *VM*            | *VM*            
| `Compute`              | *Compute*       | *Compute*       | *Compute*       
| `Networking`           | *Networking*    | *Networking*    | *Networking*    
| `Storage`              | *Storage*       | *Storage*       | *Storage*       

### Serverless computing

> The cloud provider automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.
> Serverless architectures are highly scalable, and event driven. They use resources only when a specific trigger or
> occurs. The servers are still there  of course, but it is transparent to the developer.

### Public, Private and Hybrid Clouds:

 - **Public Clouds** are available to all that want them. Operated by a provider and available over the internet
 - **Private Cloud** are available exclusively to one organization; can be physically hosted on site at the organization
   or by a third party service provider.
 - **Hybrid Cloud:** combines both the above and allows data and apps to be shared between them
 
> Note: On a Hybrid cloud, placing components in the private cloud comes with higher costs and administration, where as 
> placing them in the public domain comes with a lower cost and administration.


## What is Azure?

> Azure an expanding set of cloud services that helps your organization meet current and future business challenges.

### What are the Benefits?

 - Be ready for future
 - Build how you want and deploy where you want
 - Operate hybrid seamlessly
 - Security from the ground up

### How does it work?

  - Azure uses `Virtualization`
  - `Virtualization` decouples the hardware and the operating system using an abstraction layer called the `Hypervisor` 
  - The `Hypervisor` emulate all the functions a computer and its CPU in a virtual machine (VM)
  - Now Any VM can run any OS (Windows Linux)
  - Azure repeats this pattern on a massive scale in `Azure Data Centers`
  - `Azure Data Centers` consist of many `Racks` with `Servers`
  - Each Server has a hypervisor and each `Rack` has a `Switch`
  - The `Switches` network all the racks together
  - One server in each rack runs a `Fabric Controller`
  - Each `Fabric Controller` is connected to the `Orchestrator`
  - The `Orchestrator` has ann API 
  - Users use an UI to communicate with the `Orchestrator` via the API
  - The `Orchestrator` packages up the request, and passes it off to the fabic controller
  - The `Fabric Controller` picks a server in its rack, spins up the VM
  - The user can now connect to the VM.

### What is the Azure Portal?

> A Web based, unified portal (GUI) allowing users to manage their Azure Subscriptions. With it users can
>  - Build, Manage and Monitor resources
>  - Create custom Dashboards for organized views of resources (customizable)
>  - Configure accessibility 
>  - Start/Stop and Scale application
>  - Track costs and create reports
>  - Add user, and implement security measures

### What is the Azure Portal?

> Helps connect users with Microsoft Partners and independent software vendors offering solutions and services.
