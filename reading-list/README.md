## 2020

### A Promised Land
 - Author: Barak Obama
 - Notes: Audio Book, fun to hear what went on behind the scenes. Mentions 'Hamilton'

### Becoming
 - Author: Michelle Obama
 - Notes: Just had to read both. Some common stories in each. Mentions 'Hamilton'

## 2021

### Alexander Hamilton
 - Author: Ron Chernov
 - Notes: Read after friends finally made me watch the musical last year. Lots of Dates and names and 
   relations to remember - had trouble keeping track of things. - didn't finish - but some interesting 
   stuff.

### American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition
  - Author: Neil Gaiman (Author)
  - Notes: loved it. Saw the first episodes when they aired; long enough ago to not remember 
    much of the plot. Kept imagining the characters looking like their actor counterparts.
    waited till the end to google just who shadow really was (mythology wise).
### Death Before Decaf
  - Author: Caroline Farding
  - Notes: Having just started drinking coffee a year ago, I thought this would be a fun read.
    It was fo me.
### Temple Grandin: How the Girl Who Loved Cows Embraced Autism and Changed the World
  - Author: Sy Montgomery and Temple Grandin
  - Notes: Fun and short (technically meant for kids :) ) -but I always wanted to know a little 
    about this person.
### Ready player Two
  - Author: Ernest Cline.
  - Notes: I liked it a lot. The description of worlds sounded like fun. The premise is a bit
    easy to figure out in the first chapter (especially if you are a sci-fi fan). Would love to 
    see the day that this is mace into a movie.
### The 100 Thing Challenge: How I Got Rid of Almost Everything, Remade My Life, and Regained My Soul
  - Author Dave Bruno
  - Notes: I kept waiting for the list. But it is really not that important in the scope the message
    as a whole. I liked the point about how he bought things to try to get to some version of a person
    he thought he wanted to be. I especially liked the 'perfect day'.
### Atomic Habits
  - Author: James Clear
  - Notes: liked that 'your chosen identity reinforces your habits' - really just wanted to figure
    out a way to make 'making my bed' in the morning a habit. lol.
### Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
  - Author: J.K. Rowling
  - The movies just keep comming up everytime I turn on a tv, so I figures I should read it.
### Divergent
  - Author: Veronica Roth
  - A Fun read. I've seen the movie twice, so it was interesting to juxtapose the two.
### Insurgent 
  - Author: Veronica Roth
  - Interesting differences between the mopvie and the book
### Alegiant
  - Author: Veronica Roth
### Thinking in Pictures
 -  Author: Temple Grandin
### Surrounded by Idiots: The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and in Life)
  - Author: Thomas Erikson
  - Notes: I couldn't get past the first chapter...my mind kept drifting. 
### Other Voices, Other Rooms
  - Author: Truman Capote
  - Notes: I saw `Capote (2005)` on Netflix and thought this might be good. As I read I wondered if bits of it were autobiographical, turns out they were (or at least wikipedia thinks so).
