## Keywords

###    _ (Added in Java 9)

The underscore has become a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name anymore.

### abstract

A method with no definition must be declared as `abstract` and the `class` containing it must be declared as `abstract`.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Abstract methods must be implemented in the sub classes. The abstract keyword
cannot be used with variables or constructors. Note that an abstract class isn't required to have an abstract method at
all.

### assert (Added in J2SE 1.4)

Assert describes a predicate (a true–false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks
that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure
results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optionally enable by ClassLoader method.

### boolean

Defines a boolean variable for the values "true" or "false" only. By default, the value of boolean primitive type is
false. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type boolean.

### break

Used to end the execution in the current loop body.

### byte

The byte keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also
used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type byte.

### case

A statement in the switch block can be labeled with one or more case or default labels. The switch statement evaluates
its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label; see switch.

### catch

Used in conjunction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch block specify what to do
if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.

### char

Defines a character variable capable of holding any character of the java source file's character set.

### class

A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class
fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate
superclass of the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is implicitly Object. The class
keyword can also be used in the form Class.class to get a Class object without needing an instance of that class. For
example, String.class can be used instead of doing new String().getClass().

### const

Unused but reserved.

### continue

Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, continue resumes execution
at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

### default (Added in Java 8)

The default keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed if no
case matches the specified value; see switch. Alternatively, the default keyword can also be used to declare default
values in a Java annotation. From Java 8 onwards, the default keyword can be used to allow an interface to provide an
implementation of a method.

### do

The do keyword is used in conjunction with while to create a do-while loop, which executes a block of statements
associated with the loop and then tests a boolean expression associated with the while. If the expression evaluates to
true, the block is executed again; this continues until the expression evaluates to false.

### double

The double keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit double precision IEEE 754 floating-point
number.This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type double.

### else

The else keyword is used in conjunction with if to create an if-else statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the
expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the if are evaluated; if it evaluates to false,
the block of statements associated with the else are evaluated.

### enum (Added in J2SE 5.0)

A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class Enum.

### extends

Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass; used in an interface declaration to specify one or more
superinterfaces. Class X extends class Y to add functionality, either by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by
overriding methods of class Y. An interface Z extends one or more interfaces by adding methods. Class X is said to be a
subclass of class Y; Interface Z is said to be a subinterface of the interfaces it extends. Also used to specify an
upper bound on a type parameter in Generics.

### final

Define an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. More specifically:

- A final class cannot be subclassed
- A final method cannot be overridden
- A final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command.
- All methods in a final class are implicitly final.

### finally

Used to define a block of statements for a block defined previously by the try keyword.

### float

The `float` keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit single precision IEEE 754 floating-point
number. This 'float`keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type `float`.

### for (Updated in Java 5)

The `for` keyword is used to create a for loop. As of J2SE 5.0, the for keyword can also be used to create a so-called
"enhanced for loop",which specifies an array or Iterable object; each iteration of the loop executes the associated
block of statements using a different element in the array or Iterable.

### goto

Not Used.

### if

The if keyword is used to create an if and if/else statements

### implements

Included in a class declaration to specify one or more interfaces that are implemented by the current class. A class
inherits the types and abstract methods declared by the interfaces.

### import  (Updated in Java 5.0)

Used at the beginning of a source file to specify classes or entire Java packages to be referred to later without
including their package names in the reference. Since J2SE 5.0, import statements can import static members of a class.

### instanceof

A binary operator that takes an object reference as its first operand and a class or interface as its second operand and
produces a boolean result. The instanceof operator evaluates to true if and only if the runtime type of the object is
assignment compatible with the class or interface.

### int

The int keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is
also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type int.

### interface

Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract or default methods, constant (static final) fields
and static interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the implements keyword.

### long

The long keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is
also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type long.

### native

Used in method declarations to specify that the method is not implemented in the same Java source file, but rather in
another language.

### new

Used to create an instance of a class or array object. Using keyword for this end is not completely necessary (as
exemplified by Scala), though it serves two purposes: it enables the existence of different namespace for methods and
class names, it defines statically and locally that a fresh object is indeed created, and of what runtime type it is (
arguably introducing dependency into the code).

### non-sealed

Used to declare that a class or interface which extends a sealed class can be extended by unknown classes.

### package

A Java `package` is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the `package` keyword.

### private

The `private` keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; private members can only be
accessed by other members of their own class.

### protected

The `protected` keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; protected members can only be
accessed by members of their own class, that class's subclasses or classes from the same package.

### public

The `public` keyword is used in the declaration of a class, method, or field; public classes, methods, and fields can be
accessed by the members of any class.

### return

Used to finish the execution of a method. It can be followed by a value required by the method definition that is
returned to the caller.

### short

The short keyword is used to declare a field that can hold a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is
also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type short.

### static

Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless
of how many instances exist of that class. static also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are
bound to the class instead of to a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. (Classes and interfaces
declared as static members of another class or interface are actually top-level classes and are not inner classes.)

### strictfp (Added in J2SE 1.2)

A Java keyword used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations to ensure portability.

### super

Inheritance basically used to achieve dynamic binding or run-time polymorphism in java. Used to access members of a
class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of
its superclass. The super keyword is also used to forward a call from a constructor to a constructor in the superclass.
Also used to specify a lower bound on a type parameter in Generics.

### switch

The switch keyword is used in conjunction with case and default to create a switch statement, which evaluates a
variable, matches its value to a specific case, and executes the block of statements associated with that case. If no
case matches the value, the optional block labelled by default is executed, if included.

### synchronized

Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the current thread
executes the code. For static methods, the object locked is the class's Class. Guarantees that at most one thread at a
time operating on the same object executes that code. The mutex lock is automatically released when execution exits the
synchronized code. Fields, classes and interfaces cannot be declared as synchronized.

### this

Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. this can be used to access class members and as a
reference to the current instance. The `this` keyword is also used to forward a call from one constructor in a class to
another constructor in the same class.

### throw

Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing
exception handler declared by the catch keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception
handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no
exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught
exception handler.

### throws

Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next
higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of RuntimeException must be
declared using the throws keyword.

### transient

Declares that an instance field is not part of the default serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized,
only the values of its non-transient instance fields are included in the default serial representation. When an object
is deserialized, transient fields are initialized only to their default value. If the default form is not used, e.g.
when a serialPersistentFields table is declared in the class hierarchy, all transient keywords are ignored.

### try

Defines a block of statements that have exception handling. If an exception is thrown inside the try block, an optional
catch block can handle declared exception types. Also, an optional finally block can be declared that will be executed
when execution exits the try block and catch clauses, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. A try block
must have at least one catch clause or a finally block.

### void

The void keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value.

### volatile

Used in field declarations to guarantee visibility of changes to variables across threads. Every read of a volatile
variable will be read from main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be
written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache. Methods, classes and interfaces thus cannot be declared volatile,
nor can local variables or parameters.

### while

The while keyword is used to create a while loop, which tests a boolean expression and executes the block of statements
associated with the loop if the expression evaluates to true; this continues until the expression evaluates to false.
This keyword can also be used to create a do-while loop; see do. Reserved Identifiers

## Restricted

The following identifiers are not keywords, however they are restricted in some contexts:

### permits

The permits clause specifies the classes that are permitted to extend a sealed class. record

### sealed

A sealed class or interface can only be extended or implemented only by classes and interfaces permitted to do so.

### var

A special identifier that cannot be used as a type name (since Java 10).

### yield

Used to set a value for a switch expression

## Reserved words for literal values

### true

A boolean literal value.

### false

A boolean literal value.

### null

A reference literal value.

## Unused

### const

Although reserved as a keyword in Java, const is not used and has no function. For defining constants in Java, see the
final keyword.

### goto

Although reserved as a keyword in Java, goto is not used and has no function.
